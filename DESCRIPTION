Title: Estimating mulitplicity of infection from high-throughput sequencing data
Version: 0.0.2.9001
Authors@R: "Stuart Lee <lee.s@wehi.edu.au> [aut, cre]"
Description: Evaluate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of organisms using 
    binomial mixture models and other population genetics methods. moimix can be
    used to simulate  single nucleotide variant (SNV) data from samples with 
    known MOI.
